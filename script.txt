JOSH: Oh, hey guys! I’m gonna go look upstairs.

JAY: Or a big kid.
RAZZ: Think a little kid. 
JAY: Yeah [unintelligible]
RAZZ: must’ve not even been done playing with his toys when…
JAY: …when disaster struck?
RAZZ: When disaster struck.
JAY: What do you think happened?
RAZZ: I don’t know… I mean… everything’s just in total disarray! So whatever happened must’ve been quick, but I don’t see any blood.
[camera continues around the room, passing over marks on the wall]
JAY: What are those marks on the wall?
RAZZ: Don’t know… maybe signs of a struggle?
[door loudly and slowly creaking] 
JAY: What was [unintelligible]?

JAY: His phone’s still on…
JOSH: AH!

RAZZ: JAY! [unintelligible] We gotta get out of here!
[screaming and running, running and screaming]
RAZZ: I don’t—I don’t see him.
JAY: What the hell… we need to get out of here.
[walk up to the door]
RAZZ: Okay, yeah [unintelligible] he gave you his keys right?
JAY: I don’t—the—it doesn’t matter, the door’s locked! Maybe the fucking ghosts or whatever got here before we did! 
RAZZ: I don’t—did you hear that? I heard scratching.
[jay tries the back door]
RAZZ: Locked?
JAY: Locked. Guess we’re trapped.
JOSH: AHHHH!!!!
[shirtless josh attacks and is pushed over the couch by razz, where he passes out leaving his pits fully exposed to the camera]
RAZZ: I-is--is he…?
JAY: Is he dead?
RAZZ: I don’t… know! 
JAY: I would hope now.
RAZZ: [unintelligible]

JAY: I heard—he’s not dead, but that doesn’t matter right now. We just need to get out of here.
[dragging josh along]
JAY: Where are we taking him?
RAZZ: I don’t know! We can—wasn’t there a room back there? We can close him in there.
[continuing to drag josh]
RAZZ: Why him?! He was the nicer one!
JAY: I know! 
[stumble across josh’s clothes on the floor]
RAZZ: Are those his clothes?!
JAY: They’re his—there’s his shirt—and his shoes! And his jacket!
RAZZ: What is going on?!
JAY: I have no idea.
12:33 a.m.
RAZZ: Alright, he’s in. Alright. I don’t think he’s gonna be waking up any time soon, just make sure—right, keep those closed.
[jay closes the door to the bedroom that josh is now ‘locked in’]
JAY: Alright.
RAZZ: I’m gonna… I’m gonna go see if—could find his keys around. Or something, something hard, you know, to like—[scream]

[everyone screaming]
JAY: What the fuck is going on here?
1:00 a.m.
JAY: Where is everybody? This is not safe… it hasn’t been safe…

THE NEW ONE:
It’s a dark and cloudy night over [Hunter’s Green]. 
A night like this could remind you of another night, where three friends went for a drive…
…hoping to see the only abandoned house in Hunter’s Green.
[card with Time, date, place]
[picks up when we’re actually there, not in the car]
[car engine off sfx]
RAZZ (smirk): So, legend has it the previous inhabitants ‘passed away of mysterious causes.’
JAY (unimpressed): Yeah, legend. Myth. 
[car door slam sfx]
JOSH (normal): Anyway, now that we’re actually here… 
[remote car lock sfx]
[display house bg]
JOSH: Time to find out if this place is haunted.
JAY: Or not.
[show razz and josh (unimpressed) sprites, ellipsis]
RAZZ (unimpressed, eyes closed): We won’t find anything out here.
JOSH (smile(?)): Let’s look for a way in.
JAY: Nobody brought a key? 
[first point and click with clickable areas being the front door, multiple blunt objects, and the window]
[breaking in through the window: LIVING ROOM]
[display living room bg and cat eyes]
RAZZ (creeped): Look at this place…
[display razz and jay sprites together]
JAY (default): I scouted this place once before and—
RAZZ (unimpressed): Okay, well, I guess we weren’t all on top of our game.
[display all three]
JOSH (unimpressed): Anyway, looks like the living room’s still here. 
RAZZ (smirk): Very dusty. Did you scout that out?
[display jay unimpressed]
The furniture is covered in cobwebs. A thick layer of dust sits on every surface, and even the air feels thick with long-term neglect. 
On the coffee table is [key item]. 
JAY (default): It doesn’t look like it’s been touched in years. 
JOSH: Hey guys, I’m gonna go look upstairs!
[clear screen] 
[show stairs bg]
[show josh default sprite]
RAZZ (scared): We should stay together!
JAY (surprised): Is that a good idea? That’s not a good idea.
JOSH (unimpressed): It’s a good idea.

[breaking in through the front: ENTRYWAY]
[display entryway bg]
RAZZ (unimpressed): Well, clearly this is the entryway. Nothing special here.
JAY (smirk): I thought you were sure this place was haunted.
JOSH (question): What kind of ghost haunts the front door?
